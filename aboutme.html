							<p>
								I am a senior undergraduate student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, graduating in May.  My major is Biomedical 
								Engineering and I also have a minor in Software	Development. Iâ€™m from Mauritius which is a tropical island located to the east of Madagascar
								(refer to pictures below). I am a very goal and purpose oriented.  I enjoy solving problems, helping 
								others, and working towards impactful goals. My top 5 strengths are Furutistic, Strategic, Analytical, Deliberative, and Individualization.								
							</p>			

							<p>
								I have always been a very curious person. Growing  up, I was known to be the very annoying kid who would always ask 
								a lot of questions and I have always had that unsatiable hunger towards figuring things out. I also loved and enjoyed building things.
								My brain has always been full of ideas, and I was someone that could not sit still, so I spent most of my free time building random things.
								I would build anything that I would stimulate my creativity and push me to think more. It would be anything from a cage for my rabbits 
								to electronic gadgets that I would build out of my broken toys. 
							</p>

							<p>
								I have always had a big empathy for people, especially for people in need. I could never grasp the idea that some of us do not have 
								basic things like a place to live, clothes, or even water while none of it is their fault. I have always had strong emotions towards 
								these things and from a very young age, I had always been drawn to the idea of one day solving real world problems in a sustainable 
								manner. Over time I realized that perhaps my purpose was to use my passion in solving problems as a tool and those strong emotions as 
								a driving factor to somehow help people in a sustainable manner. That eventually led me to an engineering degree. 
							</p>

							<p>
								One of the ways in which underprivileged people suffer the most is in terms of their health. It is very well known that 
								some of the leading health issues in many third world countries are diseases like diarrhea and malnutrition. These are 
								not diseases that we have no cure for. There simply is a gap between the cures we currently have and certain demographics 
								that need them. Therefore, there is still work to be done to make the solutions to these diseases more affordable or 
								perhaps more readily available. That is an example of the problems that I could work towards every day and feel fulfilled 
								and purposeful irrespective of whether I succeed. That is why I chose Biomedical Engineering as my career though I do 
								recognize that solving real world problems often require the knowledge and expertise from more than one engineering field 
								in combination with other disciplines. I firmly believe that education is a never-ending process, and the plan is to tackle
								health related problems whether they mean creating new solutions or improving existing ones while continuously learning 
								and growing along the way. 
							</p>

							<p>
								Simply put, my goal is to be purposeful every day in everything that I do while striving to be the best version of 
								myself.  Some of my roles models whose paths I use to guide myself are Nelson Mandela, Albert Einstein, Nikola Tesla, 
								Leonardo Da Vinci, Prophet Muhammad (P.B.U.H), Martin Luther King, Lord Buddha, and many more. However, who I am 
								trying to become is who I was when I was a kid before I was told who I needed to be. Humble with an unshakably enthusiastic 
								mindset where the only two options that ever existed were to make it to the end or to get a little closer to it.
